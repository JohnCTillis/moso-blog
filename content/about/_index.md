# Hi, my name is John Tillis
### I am a self-thought software engineer

- I would say I'm most proficient in building backend
- Some of the tools I know best are:
  - Python (my first programming language)
  - Javascript (i like typescript too, but dont really use it as often)
  - C/C++ (for when I need to make something super low-level)
  - Java (i know, but sometimes I actually really enjoy the design patterns of Java)
